# ReactSimpleBookstore
The purpose of this project was to practice my recently acquired React skills. It's a pretty basic Online Bookstore that allows users to add and remove items from the cart. It also shows the total amount of money it would take to buy the items in the cart. Wow, so fancy.

# To-Do-List
- Make it responsive
- Add a component for when the cart is empty
- Add notification popups
- Make it consume an API instead of using a hardcoded book list

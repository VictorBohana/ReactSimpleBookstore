      summary: "A Brief History of Time is an exploration of the forces that govern our universe. At the heart of it all is the search for a theory that explains the history and evolution of our universeâ€”how it began, how it works, and what the future might hold for it. We journey to the vast reaches of the observable universe and inside the very tiniest particles that comprise its building blocks as we explore the nature of time and space, the origins of our universe through the Big Bang, the forces that give rise to phenomena like black holes, and the possibilities of time travel."
